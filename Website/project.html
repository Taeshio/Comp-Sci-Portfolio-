    <p> Here are all of the projects I've done over the course of this expedition class of my 9th grade year at everest. The three projects I have worked on are: 1. An Animal Crossing soundboard 2. A text-based adventure game and 3. a drop down calculator</p>
  
    <p> Here is one of my projects. A soundboard with an Animal crossing theme. It plays various themes from animal crossing new leaf, a game for the 3ds.</p>
<p> Another one of my projects was a textbased adventure game.This was a collaborative project between Maja, Ashley, and I. We split up three paths and each of us took up multiple actions and endings based on the player's choices. Most of the paths end in death, but the ending is nice...that is, if you get to it.</p>
