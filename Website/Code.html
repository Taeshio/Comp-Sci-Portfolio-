      <p> What is code? Hm...thats quite hard to say. It depends on the kind of code you're talking about. The we're doing in computer science allows us to make many things. From webpages to little flash games.</p>
      
      <title> What is HTML? </title>
      
      <p> HTML is an acronym for Hyper Text Markup Language. This coding language is most commonly used to make webpages. It is also linkable to CSS and Javascript. HTML was created by a physicist named Tim Berners-lee. HTMl is written with tags. Tags look like (for example)<tag>. </p>
          
      <p> CSS is an acronym for Cascading Style Sheets. This coding langauge is used for visual improvement. It is also a more efficient/more organized way to style your HTML. For example, you could use the style tag on every paragraph, but thats just tedious. Using CSS, you can just put the p into a css style sheet and then just add all the visual changes in the linked sheet. Plus, it'll make your code look more organised. CSS was thought of by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. During that time he was working with the creator of Html, Tim Berners-lee. CSS's syntax consists of various style elements which are triggerd by a certain tag in htm which is defined in CSS by a class.</p>
