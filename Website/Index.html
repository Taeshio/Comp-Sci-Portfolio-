<p> Anyways...on to the main point, I am currently taking an expeditions class on computer science. Where is this class located? Room 201 in Everest High. The person who teaches this class is Mr. Hesby.</p>
        
<p> Why are we taking this class and what do we hope to accomplish. Well I decided to take this class because It seemed the most appealing out of all the classes. Plus, I like being on the computer, so that was a pro. And my dad works for a software engineering company, so I thought about following in his footsteps. At the end of the class we would have learned. CSS, HTML, and Javascript</p>
