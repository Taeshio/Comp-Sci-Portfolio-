   <center> <p style= font-size: 90px; color: yellow> Things about me: I like video games, reading a good book, poetry, and computers. </p> </center>
    <p> I enjoy video games in the genres of RPG (role playing games), Puzzle games, and rhythm games </p>
    <p> some rpgs I have played lately: </p>
     <table id="t01">
  <tr>
   <table border="1" style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>Bravely Default</td>
    <td>Pokemon X and Y</td> 
    <td>Liberation Maiden</td>
  </tr>
</table>
    <p> Why do I like RPG: Games like those usually involve strategies and careful planning. I also really like combat in Rpgs, especially turn based fighting.

  <p> some puzzle games i've played lately </p>
        
        <table id="t01">
  <tr>
   <table border="1" style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>Proffesor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright</td>
    <td>Proffesor Layton and the Miracle Mask</td> 
    <td>Proffesor Layton and the Last Spector</td>
  </tr>
</table>
       <p> Why do I play puzzle games?: I want to use my brain once and a while. Most video games fry your brain,so puzzle games are at least a tiny bit educational </p>

                                                                                                                        <p> I write poetry a lot in my spare time, usually Tanka or Haiku</p>
    
    <p> Why poetry?: I know what you are thinking, "this kid writes poetry what a weirdo". But most people don't understand or don't want to understand the deep meaning of a few words.</p>
